# HyperVWebViewer
HyperVWebViewer is a web application viewer of VMs on the Hyper-V written in golang.
There is an application "Hyper-V Manager" for controlling and monitoring VMs on the Hyper-V
but that is for managers, not users.

The system manager in company don't want users to change the CPU and memory on the vm, I think.
The Hyper-V Manger can do that, even thus it can change any Hyper-V setting. 

HyperVWebViewer is a web application viewer for users.
HyperVWebViewer allow users to check the VMs' information and start VMs.
